# Mentored-Project

## Why are we doing this?
This project is a great way to test our skills as to how far we have come in the QA academy by running 4 services through a jenkins pipeline.

## How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected it to be challenging as all skills we have learned throughout the academy would need to be applied to the different areas of the challenge and then brought together to create a final build.

## What didn't go to plan?
The challenge was difficult when it came to getting the different sections of the challenge to come together and work. For example; getting jenkins to work with ansible had some permission issues that would mean that the playbook would not run and hold up the jenkins pipeline.

## Possible future improvements.
In the future, I would finish getting SAST testing completed with sonarcube so that the project has been security tested.
